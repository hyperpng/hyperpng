### This page is where I share my projects, updates, and general interests (repurposing old hardware, bad web design, etc.).
## Hardware: 
  **Desktop (Windows 10)** (AMD fx cpu, radeon R7 370, 16GB DDR3, 1tb ssd)
  
  **Laptop 1 (Arch Linux)** (just some cheapo $400 acer laptop. ran like shit with windows. runs buttery smooth with linux on a tiling wm.)
  
  **Laptop 2 (Ubuntu Server LTS)** (Dell Laptop from ~2015, decent specs. currently a dedicated minecraft server.)
  
  **Raspberry Pi 3B (Raspbian 10 Buster)** (Sporting a LAMP stack, hosting my website [altos.gq](https://www.altos.gq "altos.gq"), probably will be repurposed sometime.)
## About me:
  i'm charlie, i'm 18 years old. i honestly have not done anything collaborative and so i'm not really familiar with git other than from downloading repositories to install linux packages. i'm into anti-bloat web development, hardware, free (as in freedom) software, and a bunch of other things i'm forgetting.
## Other:
  twitter where I disclose too many personal details: [@fy6se](https://www.twitter.com/fy6se "twitter.com/fy6se")
